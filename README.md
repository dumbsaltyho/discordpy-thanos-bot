# thanos bot

bans half your server (excluding the bot itself and the guild owner because you can't ban yourself or the guild owner)

2 versions:  
one will ban everyone  
one will ban everyone excluding server admins.

make sure the bot has administrator permissions, and sits above all other roles.

**requires discord.py**
